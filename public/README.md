## File + folder explanaition

### `index.html`
You probably do not need to edit this file! If you are changing the icon, just replace the images in this directory and rename them so the name matches!

### `robots.txt`
Not important for a hack, hahaha, but is read by search engine bots that scan the web for sites. It is useful if you don't want your website to appear in search.

### `favico.ico`
You know the little icon that appears in your tab bar at the top? It's that!
