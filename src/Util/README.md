## File + folder explanaition
### `firebase.js`
Firebase configuration file. When you create an app in Firebase, you will receive your own firebaseConfig option. 

In this file, I also export db and app. This is so I can access my Firestore and Firebase objects from elsewhere in the app (e.g in the `SignatureList.js`). 

You can read more about `firebase.js` [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
